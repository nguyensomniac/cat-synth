# cat-synth
A MIDI synthesizer. With cats.

Uses timbre.js to output a modulated synth.

# Usage

Meant for use with a MIDI controller, (i.e. hardware). Plug that into a USB port and make sure you have something like Hairless MIDI installed.

If so, clone the repo. Install dependencies via `npm install` or `yarn` .

Run the frontend build by running `npm start` and run the server by running `node index.js`.

This is a hack, so beware!
